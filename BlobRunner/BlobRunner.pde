 the screen an appropriate size for the

 big enough to contain all of the blobs.

 Populate the array of blobs.
 You can use any values for radius, number of sides
 and wobble factor that you'd like, but you must
 use x and y coordinates that ensure the blobs
 are drawn in a grid without overlaping each other.
 
 Your code should work for any reasonable value
 of population (i.e. something that would fit on a
 normal monitor).
