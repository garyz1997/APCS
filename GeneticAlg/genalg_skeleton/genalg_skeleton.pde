  Create an initial population of randomly

  Redraw every Individual in the population
  each frame. Make sure they are drawn in a grid without
  overlaping each other.
  If an individual has been slected (by the mouse), draw a box
  around it and draw a box around the individual with the
  highest fitness value.
  If mating mode is set to continuous, call mating season

When the mouse is clicked, set selected to
the individual clicked on, and set

drawn around it.

/*====================================
The following keys are mapped to actions:

Right Arrow: move forard one generation
Up Arrow: speed up when in continuous mode
Down Arrow: slow down when in continuous mode
Shift: toggle continuous mode
Space: reset the population
f: toggle fitness value display
s: toggle smiley display
m: increase mutation rate
n: decrease mutation rate

  select will return a pseudo-random chromosome from the population
   Uses roulette wheel selection:
     A random number is generated between 0 and the total fitness 
     Go through the population and add each member's fitness until you exceed the random 
     number that was generated.
     Return the individual that the algorithm stopped on
     Do not include the "selected" Blob as a possible return value
  ==================================*/

/*====================================

  Replaces the current population with a totally new one by
  selecting pairs of Individuals and "mating" them.
  Make sure that totalFitness is set before you use select().
  The goal shape (selected) should always be the frist Individual
  in the population, unmodified.

  in the population.
  ==================================*/

  of each individual.
  Make sure that each individual has an accurate fitness value
  ==================================*/

/*====================================
  Fill the population with randomly generated Individuals
  Make sure to set the location of each individual such that
  they display nicely in a grid.
  ==================================*/

  Go through the population and find the Individual with the 
  highest fitness value.

  square border drawn around it.
